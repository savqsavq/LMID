personal sociology data project - massive corpus on LDS church

This is a personal research project focused on LDS church related material. It is a sociology and discourse 
analysis that uses text as data. It is built by assembling a very large corpus through web scraping of public sources.

This repository only contains scripts. It does not include the analysis outputs, raw data, or databases.

The goal of the project is to analyze how different groups talk about the same institution. All of the work in this repository is used to identify early research signals. This is not a finished study.

The methods used here could apply to any large scale body of text, internet discourse, or other creative applications.
