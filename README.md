# LMID "Let's Make Informed Decisions"
personal sociology data project - massive corpus on LDS church

Here lies all of my ingestion scripts used to develop a very large 
corpus of various forms of lds church discussion available publicly

There is more ingestion to be done, but I have also applied some surface

The methodology I've employed here can be applied to Internet discourse 
about any topic
